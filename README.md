### Overview
The quality professors and instructors nowadays, especially in higher education, is important for students to learn and succeed. Although we recognize the importance of the role played by educators, most educational systems still have difficulty finding a fair evaluation for their professors and courses. UH Class Critics is a website that allows students from the University of Hawaii at Manoa to share their experiences taking different courses and professors at UH. They will be allowed to write reviews and rate instructors from the campus similar to RateMyProfessor. Students will have access to a collection of professors and courses and can evaluate them based on a rating scale of 1-5. The website allows students to share their feedback and provide others with the proper expectations when registering for courses.

### Goal
Our goal is to provide a convenient and readily accessible website where students can research and make the best decisions about courses they plan to take based on the feedback of others. We also want users to share their experiences with the courses and professors taken and critique them. The inspiration for the project came from the lack of information when it comes to choosing courses and teachers at the beginning of each semester where students have to choose and carefully plan the courses they will take. With UH Class Critics, it will be possible to research courses and educators in the areas of business, health, economics, technology and marketing, and many more. Although there will always be some uncertainty with taking a new course, having some basic idea or expectation for a course is something that is increasingly valuable for students to make the best choices during their academic journey.
